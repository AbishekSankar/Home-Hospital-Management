# About the Project - Home-Hospital-Management

## Problem Statement

Corona Virus Pandemic has changed our lives massively. More than a Million People have been affected by the COVID-19 virus in India. In most metropolitan cities the number of deaths and new cases has been rising significantly. As result Hospital beds are declining slowly. Due to the decline of hospital beds, many hospitals were unable to treat the COVID 19 positive patients Over the days, experts have understood how the virus is behaving. The majority of the people are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms that may not even require hospitalization. Preventive measures depend on the stage of transmission. Currently, it is understood that community transmission has occurred, hence it is up to the individuals to take complete control of the situation.

So, we want to create an organization that helps the current situation by providing Online Monitoring Interface which would collaborate with Major hospitals that could provide Home Hospital Management. The patient’s family member or guardian can call us or use our Online mediums (Web-page or Application) to contact us for registering in-home hospital management. After collecting the necessary details, they would provide these data to the Collaborating hospitals. Then the respective hospitals will study the patient files and they would send the doctors and nurses to patients’ homes to check the patient is fit for Home Hospital Management. If doctors suggest they need extra care, they would be sent to Hospital. Else the patient is provided with Home Hospital Environment.

To set up the Home Hospital Environment, the patient needs to be quarantined in a separate room and their family needs to be quarantined in another room. Family members are not allowed to visit the patient. Food and other medical needs will be handled by nurses. Nurses would be monitoring the patient’s status and will be feeding the data to our Interface which would be reviewed by the doctor. The doctor would monitor according to the medical status of the patient

Under the current circumstances, the Government of India has approved the much-awaited telemedicine services. So, if a patient needs medicine they can directly order the medicines on our web-page or application at any time. Medicines would be delivered to their respective address within 1 hour. The patient’s family members can order groceries and essentials, fruits and vegetables, meat and fish, food delivery, Medicines, etc. Delivery of goods will be properly sanitized and will be delivered in their respective homes.

This approach is highly helpful for less symptomatic patients as it reduces the risk of the deaths. In due course, the Government can concentrate on setting up systems and protocols to manage only severe cases either in Government or Private hospitals. This breakthrough approach is the need of the hour and needs to be meticulously implemented.

## Feasibility Study

A feasibility analysis is used to determine the viability of an idea, such as ensuring a project is legally and technically feasible as well as economically justifiable. Our project has volunteers and employees who would work hard and earn a good outcome.

### Legal Feasibility

- Legal feasibility checks the legal and ethical requirements needed to make a project successful
- Some regulations for the project are, data protection, data privacy laws should be following for the ethical functioning of the software.
- A software license agreement should be taken to successfully launch the app/website. And also, copyright laws.
- Our organization should get approval from concerned higher government officers to start any work
- After getting approval from concerned officers, we have to recruit volunteers web and software developers, customer service people.

### Economic Feasibility

- This assessment typically involves a cost/ benefits analysis of the project.
- Our organization requires a huge amount of investment to satisfy our goals.
- We should pay off salaries to employees and volunteers and provide them medical allowances if needed.
- Our sources of income include payment for creating patient’s home hospital management, delivery charges.
- With advertisements and fund, rising investment in our company may increase rapidly.

### Technical Feasibility

- Technically speaking we have to create a website application, and many toll-free helpline numbers.
- Our organization will recruit highly experienced web developers, software engineers who will maintain the webpage and online application stable at all the time.
- Our organization will recruit customer service professionals who would be highly responsive and compassionate to the customer.
- Technical problems of our organization are taken care of by the technical department. So, technical department recruiting should require high knowledge of the technical aspect of software aspects of the organization.

### Operational Feasibility

- We have experts in handling situations, they will protect the
  system(software) from server downs and crashes.
- We have expert doctors and nurses to treat patients.
- Our customer service can be available initially in local language and English,
  later on, we will provide services in all languages as we proceed.
- Since we are running everything legal, we don't encourage any fraud or mistakes in our system.

### Scheduling Feasibility

- Since we are dealing with COVID 19 patients, time is very crucial for us. So we will keep expertise man force as much as possible.
- Since we are assigning separate teams for every task and by following the "divide and conquer" rule we believe we will bring out our project in less time.
- We have chosen some best methodologies to make our software created so fast.
- We have assigned customer service as well, and through expertise people, we don't want to compromise on time delay.
- Since we kept local area doctors for treating patients, doctors can reach patients in less time.
- We have our mobile ambulance running around, we hope we can reach the patients to hospitals in no time.

## Which SDLC model is suitable for this project?

Iterative model will be the suitable software development life cycle model. The main reason is that in the iterative model we can focus on initial and simplified implementation which then progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the final system is complete.

Iterative model is suitable because,

- Our project is a long-term project and involves technical issues in the maintenance phase which can be well handled using the iterative model.
- The primary requirements of the project are well defined in the initial stage itself.
- Cost-effective compared to other SDLC models.
- Debugging and testing can be done when each module is developed which decreases the workload.
- Since iterative, we can identify risks, issues at each iteration and can rectified earlier.

### Phases in the Iterative Model

#### Requirements gathering and analysis

- In this phase, we gather a list of requirements like functional and non-functional requirements and we analyze whether those requirements can be fulfilled or not.

- Functional Requirements are registration, report generation, and database of SRS.
- Non-functional Requirements are software quality, security, integrity, and maintainability.

#### System Design

- In this phase, we define the hardware and software requirements that help in the overall system architecture.

- Software Requirements are visual studio 2015 IDE for software development and the languages used are Python, HTML, and CSS. The database used is SQLite3.
- Hardware Requirements include, compatible with Windows and Android for mobile users. There are no other hard disk and RAM specifications required.

#### Development

- In this phase, the development team starts coding using the specifications documentation, planning, and Design documentation developed in the earlier phases.

- The front end development team includes web developers for front-end developers, IT team for backend development, Data analyst, and Plan executer.

#### Testing

- Once the development of a particular module is ready, the testing team comes to work in order to identify and defects in the implementation.

- Testing done are Unit testing and system testing, white box testing, functional testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.

#### Review/Evaluation

- In this phase, evaluation of development is done. Here the entire team, clients, and other teams have access to the current completion of the projects, and their feedback is taken into account for further iterations.

## Stepwise Planning

### Step 0: Select Project

- We have selected our project to overcome the current pandemic situation. Our project focuses on COVID – 19 patients who don’t need severe medications to overcome covid and those who can get rid of covid with normal medications. We have done a feasibility study to check whether this project is feasible in all possible ways to proceed further.

### Step 1: Select project scope and objectives

- Our project’s main objective is to provide software that helps the current situation by providing Online Monitoring Interface which would collaborate with Major hospitals that could provide Home Hospital Management. In recent days, we all needed resources like oxygen, beds, and a proper guide to overcoming COVID-19. So, home hospital management provides an interface to overcome COVID – 19 with continuous and proper monitoring by the doctors on the appointed date and provides medications based on the doctor’s report. The effectiveness of this software is measured by the customer's (nurses, doctors, patient’s family members) feedbacks.

### Step 2: Identify project infrastructure

- Since we are developing a website that helps our objective and also almost every people are using electronic gadgets like smartphones, computers, we don’t have to provide any infrastructure or standards. We can use any authorized search engine to visit our website. And for the hardware requirements, the basic hardware requirements will be sufficient.

### Step 3: Analyze project Characteristics

- Our website provides separate login for admin, doctors, and patients, and all the patients and doctors information is stored in a database that maintains a well-defined information system providing privacy to that information. Every time the user logins, the data is stored in the database. We are using SQLite to store the user data. Medications can be easily taken care and the software that we have developed helps the family members to know about a particular patient’s health by the assigned doctor’s reports uploaded on the website. When any patient needs a doctor’s help (for medication-related clarifications, appointment time change, or some emergency), they can make appointments on spot and clear the clarifications.
- We have estimated to finish our project in less than 4 months as we need 3 months to deploy and the cost estimated for each department is mentioned below,

  - Front-end developer – 25k per month
  - Back-end developer – 35k per month
  - Software engineers – 25k per month
  - Maintenance Team – 35k per person-month

### Step 4: Identify product and activities

#### Login module

We have created 3 separate logins for doctors where they are allowed to enter details like name, department/category, experience, workspace, and available time. The second login is for patients where they enter name, address. Phone number, symptoms, and so on to register and can use their user’s name and can proceed with selecting doctor for monitoring and other activities. The third login is for admin who maintains the availability of doctors, hospital beds availability.

#### Register for COVID test

If the user finds mild covid symptoms, he/she can do an appointment to do the test and wait for a person to do the test and the result will be posted in the website’s result column.

#### Home medication

If the result says moderate symptoms, then a message telling “You are eligible for Home Hospital Management”. So, they need to register for home hospital management in the button displayed on the result page to start the treatment. Mandatory protocols to be followed will be displayed on the website. Once they are done with the initial protocol’s doctors’ appointment is made and medications will be displayed and are monitored by the appointed doctor frequently.

#### Clear Test

Once 14days of quarantine comes to an end, another test is taken to evaluate covid. If the result is negative, he/she can get himself/herself out of quarantined and post medications will be given that should be strictly followed and in case positive, medications and quarantine period continue till cured.

#### Database connectivity

We have created databases for maintaining doctors' details and patients' details, patient’s discharge details, appointment details using SQLite Database. The appointment database contains details about the patient, doctor, description of the appointment. The doctor database contains all the personal details about the doctor and his department. The patient database contains personal details of the patient, symptoms, doctor assigned to him. Patient discharge details contain the details of patient details and fees charged for his medical treatment.

### Step 5: Estimate effort for each activity

The activities involved here are register, login, make appointments, medication supply, and monitoring. For all these activities we approximately need 4 months of duration and for each activity, we need a minimum of 17 days of development to achieve its objective. And finally, testing and deployment may take 15 days of work.

### Step 6: Identify activity risks

The risks may include, absence of employees in any phases of deployment may risk the delay of project completion. The other risk is cost. Considering software and hardware requirements, resources, and hours they work each day (here only 2 people are developing this software, so it won’t cost much but if proceeding further to launch this software we need to do so much testing that involves high expense), the overall cost is estimated. If the cost increases beyond the estimation that creates chaos among the team. Mainly expense increases when the maintenance team takes part after deployment.

#### Risk Matrix

| Likelihood | Impact |
| ---------- | ------ |
| L          | Low    |
| M          | Medium |
| H          | High   |

#### Now for the risks listed

| Risk list                               | Importance | Impact                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Absence of key employees                | H          | M                           |
| Cost increases more than the estimation | M          | L                           |
| Database issues                         | M          | L (for a short period only) |
| When project completion is delayed      | L          | L                           |

### Step 7: Allocate resources

For all products and their activities,The team involved – Software Engineer, web developer (front end and back end), and tester. Other resources – Development environment for workers.

### Step 8: Review/Publicize plan

Now the project plan is ready and we need to get the agreement of acceptance for the plan from all workers involved. As of now, only 2 students (Akshayavarshini and Abhishek) are the only workers. If both agree and the project authority agrees, we can move with the execution of the plan.

### Step 9 and 10: Execute the plan and Lower-Level planning

Once the plan is approved by the authority, we can proceed with the execution part. Though every step is planned some may issue may occur at any stage we should always be ready to handle such issues. With stepwise planning, we can plan and execute our project in a structured manner.

## Risk Planning and Control

### Identifying Risks

The identification of risks is critical to the project's success. Possible dangers are detected here, and possible countermeasures must be implemented in the next stage. The risk register is a detailed inventory of the most significant hazards that serve as the foundation for the Risk Management Plan.The following are some of the potential risks associated with our project:

- Automation of all works in hospital management is a difficult task here, If we don’t do it properly it may end up in failure, which particularly is fairly significant. ex: automated patient discharge pages should be designed properly otherwise the whole system may get collapsed.
- Legal risks: Obtaining important clearances and orders from local government officials and, more specifically, hospital officials in a non-obtrusive manner.
- Human risk: Doctors and nurses are at a high risk of viral transmission because they work in hospitals and are responsible for a large number of patients.
- The server, which is an important part of our system, manages all of the data in a large amount of space. It may encounter a variety of technical issues.
- It is difficult to deal primarily with in-home hospital management patients with substantial symptoms.
- Financial risks: Because the expense of a home hospital environment might fluctuate depending on a variety of external and internal circumstances.
- Production risks: Due to a variety of reasons, the cost of production and expenses may exceed the anticipated amount.
- In both rural and urban environments, establishing home hospital management is quite challenging.
- Some patients may not be familiar with how to utilize current technology such as smartphones and laptops, making it difficult for patients to use the platform in a nuanced manner.
- As the number of active users grows, which is usually reasonably substantial, managing all of the data in the database gets increasingly complex.
- Because the system is specially designed to run on the web, it is unquestionably exposed to exploitation and cybersecurity risks.

## Possible Risks Mitigation Strategies

- Automation of all works in hospital management is a difficult task here, If we don’t do it properly it may end up in failure, which particularly is fairly significant. ex: automated patient discharge pages should be designed properly otherwise the whole system may get collapsed.

  - **Solution** : The risk of automating chores will be greatly decreased by delegating key design and programming tasks to highly trained personnel and modestly reducing testing time.

- Legal risks: Obtaining important clearances and orders from local government officials and, more specifically, hospital officials in a non-obtrusive manner.

  - **Solution** : Understand and adhere to state and federal healthcare regulations. Establish positive relationships with cooperating hospitals and resolve their problems. Examine your company's insurance policies and make sure you have enough liability coverage.

- Human risk: Doctors and nurses are at a high risk of viral transmission because they work in hospitals and are responsible for a large number of patients.

  - **Solution** : To mitigate the risk of spreading, doctors and nurses should follow the hospital norms and the management. For example, it should be compulsory for all healthcare workers to wear adequate PPE suits and N95 masks.

- The server, which is an important part of our system, manages all of the data in a large amount of space. It may encounter a variety of technical issues.

  - **Solution** : Servers should be maintained by staff with extensive experience and training; regular and thorough maintenance will eliminate the majority of server dangers.
  - It is difficult to deal primarily with in-home hospital management patients with substantial symptoms.

- Financial risks: Because the expense of a home hospital environment might fluctuate depending on a variety of external and internal circumstances.

  - **Solution** : Because the hospital must utilize staff to set up all of the essential machines, and the machine and labor costs are somewhat high, implementing home hospital management comes at a significant cost. As a result, management must conduct these operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

- Production risks: Due to a variety of reasons, the cost of production and expenses may exceed the anticipated amount.

  - **Solution** : The number of patients enrolled in the system determines the company's profit, and the management must generate sufficient funds through aggressive promotion.

- In both rural and urban environments, establishing home hospital management is quite challenging.

  - **Solution** : Developing home hospital management in rural and urban locations is difficult because people may lack the necessary funding and knowledge to benefit from it. As a result, if the company makes more money, the management may be able to reduce costs.

- Some patients may not be familiar with how to utilize current technology such as smartphones and laptops, making it difficult for patients to use the platform in a nuanced manner.
  - **Solution** : Customer service Agents can support patients in learning and gaining access to modern equipment, hence reducing patient illiteracy.
  - As the number of active users grows, which is usually reasonably substantial, managing all of the data in the database gets increasingly complex.
- Because the system is specially designed to run on the web, it is unquestionably exposed to exploitation and cybersecurity risks.
  - **Solution** : IT security professionals should thoroughly examine and scan the system for vulnerabilities and flaws. They must communicate with the development team and engineers in order to lead them in the creation of a robust and impermeable system.
